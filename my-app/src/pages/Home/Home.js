                <h1>Newmarket</h1>
                <p>Incorporated in 1727, Newmarket is one of six towns granted by Massachusetts in the last year of the reign of King George I. It started as a parish of Exeter, and was granted full town privileges by the legislature in 1737. It was probably named for Newmarket in Suffolk, England. The Lamprey River, running through the town, was named for John Lamprey, an early settler. For a while, the town was called "Lampreyville". Newmarket was a center of the New England shipping trade with the West Indies,including importation of sugar and African slaves.</p>

                <p>The Newmarket Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1822, and constructed its first cotton textile mill during 1823 and 1824. The company dominated the mill town's waterfront and economy with seven textile mills harnessing water power at the falls. The company had cotton shipped up from the Deep South, so its production was adversely affected by the Civil War. It built numerous support structures, including multi-family housing for workers. The company built dams far upriver to create Pawtuckaway Pond in Nottingham and Mendums Pond in Barringtonâ€”during drought, the company could release a regulated flow of water from the dams into the Lamprey to run the works. The company closed in 1929.</p>

                <p>Adapted for modern commercial and residential uses, the mill buildings are located within the Newmarket Industrial and Commercial Historic District, which in 1980 was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1970s, the mill served as the headquarters of the Timberland Company, during the years when it grew from a small work-boot manufacturer to a leading "urban" fashion brand. Timberland's headquarters are now located in nearby Stratham.</p>

                <p>Once a part of Newmarket, Newfields incorporated as a separate town in 1849.</p>

                <p>The town of Newmarket has a small, but growing and significant, Laotian and Laotian American population, refugees and their families. Buddhist practitioners among the Laotians attend the Wat Lao Mixarayam Temple in Lowell, Massachusetts.</p>
